\section*{Appendix}





\section{English Translation of Logical Or $\lor$}
$b_1$ Logical Or $b_2$ is spoken in English as "at least one of the following is true. $b_1$. $b_2.$"
\subsection{English Example}
At least one of the following is true.\\
Most dogs have four legs.\\
Two plus three is equal to 5.
\subsection{Criticism of "Logical Or" In Computer Science}
In Computer Science, $b_1$ Logical Or $b_2$ is often spoken as "$b_1$ or $b_2$". "$b_1$ or $b_2$" can lead to inconsistent statements.\\
\begin{center}
$b_1 = ($int $3 \subset [1,2,3])$\\
\vspace{2mm}
$b_2 = ((2 + 2) == 5)$\\
\end{center}
\vspace{2mm}
The following is a valid expression in Computer Science
\begin{center}
$
b_1 \lor b_2 = \mathbb{T}
$
\end{center}
The expression is read in English as "3 is in the list 1 2 3 or 2 plus 2 is equal to 5". The expression is True by definition but $b_1$ or $b_2$
do not necessarily imply Truth.\\\\
\begin{center}
$b_1 = ($int $3 \subset [1,2,3])$\\
\vspace{2mm}
$b_2 = ($int $3 \not \subset [1,2,3])$\\
\end{center}
\vspace{2mm}
The following is a valid expression in Computer Science
\begin{center}
$
 b_1 \lor b_2 =  b_1 \lor \lnot b_1 = \mathbb{T}
$
\end{center}
The expression is read in English as "3 is in the list 1 2 3 or 3 is not in the list 1 2 3 is True". The expression is necessarily true.\\
\\Now consider
\begin{center}
$
 b_1 \land b_2 =  b_1 \land \lnot b_1 = \mathbb{F}
$
\end{center}
The expression is read in English as "3 is in the list 1 2 3 and 3 is not in the list 1 2 3 is True". The expression in computer science evaluates to false


\section{English Translation of "Exclusive Or" XOR}
"$b_1$ Exclusive Or $b_2$" is read in English as "Either $b_1$ Or $b_2$"
\subsection{Example}
Either\\
Three plus four is equal to seven\\
or\\
Three plus four is equal to eight
\subsection{Criticism of English Expression of "Exclusive Or"}
"Exclusive Or" is often expressed as "Or" in English.\\
I can order the salad for lunch\\
or\\
I can order tofu for lunch

\section{Commentary on "Logical And"}
In English, "$b_1$ Logical And $b_2$" is read as "And"
\subsection{Example}
Most dogs have four legs\\
and\\
Most cats have four legs


\section{Criticism logical union, set union, logical and, set and}
- logical or is a function logical and is a function\\
- language muks up our understanding\\

Logical or $\lor$ is different from $\cup$
Logical and $\land$ is different from $\cap$

Logical or, only one has to be true\\
Logical and, both have to be true --> I'll take the intersection\\

Set and, I'll take bag 1 and bag 2 i'll take both --> I'll take the union\\
set or, I'll take bag 1 or bag 2 I'll take just one\\

Do we ever confuse set union, set and with logical or, and?\\
(Don't we describe set union $\cup$ as "or")
